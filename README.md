# Simple Chip8 emulator
A simple emulator written in C using a small engine I built do display graphics and catching input.

# Build
run ``` CMakeLists.txt ``` using cmake. Make sure when cloning the repository with git to use the ``` --recursion ``` command to properly clone also the submodules. All external libraries used are in the vendor folder.
